          <p>"For my birthday, my fiancÃ© purchased the bootcamp service from Gold Gym. We were new to Reading and I wanted to find a new workout spot.  I am stronger than when I started and I love how every bootcamp is different.  Gold Gym is judgment free and I feel like everyone is a motivator.  I joined Shred Challenge III because I wanted to challenge myself with something different.  It was great to have everything laid out for us from the beginning.  It has helped me physically and mentally; Iâ€™m so lucky to have found Gold Gym."</p>
